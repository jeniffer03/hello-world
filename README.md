A bank of ideas could become new projects, even new concept

My name is Jeniffer, I am 25 years old and I describe myself as a perseverant, hard-worker and transversal-knowledges-passionated person. I was born in Ecuador, but since I was 6 years old, I have lived in Mallorca, the Netherlands, and now I am based in Madrid.

After my first school day in Mallorca, where classes were taken only in Catalan, a language that I did not speak in those days, I decided to move forward day by day. Now, apart of Catalan, I am fluent in English and I am on my way to be so in French.
